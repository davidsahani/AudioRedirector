# 🔊 Audio Redirector: Redirect audio from one device to another

**Audio Redirector** is a simple application that lets you redirect audio from a capture or loopback device to any playback device.  

*Inspired by the need to play sound on both my speakers and headphones at the same time.*

### ⚠️ Known Issue

**StartRedirection fails often**: The current solution is to **keep trying until it starts**.  

The issue appears to be related to the [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) backend, which is currently difficult for me to spare effort for diagnosing the issue.

For a more reliable solution, I may have to consider **implementing redirection directly using native audio APIs**.

## 🛠️ Getting Qt

To build and run this project, you need to have Qt installed. You can download it from one of the following sources:

* 🌐 **Official Online Installer:** https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer
* 📦 **Official Release Archives (for offline/older versions):** https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt

### 🌏 Mirror Selection

When downloading Qt, it's often faster to use a local mirror. For users in **India**, we recommend:

* 🇯🇵 JAIST Mirror: https://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub/qtproject

You can explicitly set a mirror when launching the installer. For example:

```bash
qt-online-installer-windows-x64-4.9.0.exe --mirror https://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub/qtproject
```

📝 Replace the installer name with the version you've downloaded, if different.
